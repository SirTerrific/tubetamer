## What Is This?

BrainRotGuard puts you in control of what your kids watch on YouTube — without standing over their shoulder.

Your child gets a simple web page on their tablet where they can search YouTube and request videos. Every request sends you a Telegram message with the video thumbnail, title, channel, and duration. You tap **Approve** or **Deny** right in the chat. If approved, the video starts playing on their tablet automatically.

No YouTube account needed. No ads. No algorithmic rabbit holes. No "up next" autoplay.

### How It Works

```
Kid's Tablet ----> BrainRotGuard Server ----> Router ----> Telegram Cloud ----> Parent's Phone
                        |
                  Tablet lockdown (Family Link / Screen Time)
                  only BrainRotGuard PWA allowed
```

1. Kid opens BrainRotGuard on their tablet and searches for a video
2. They tap **Request** on the one they want to watch
3. You get a Telegram notification with all the details
4. You tap **Approve** or **Deny**
5. Their screen updates automatically — approved videos play right away

### Screenshots

Works on any screen size — desktop, tablet, and phone:

### Why I Built This

<details>
<summary>The short version: YouTube's algorithm was winning, and every parental control was either too strict or too loose.</summary>

I'm a father of a preteen son. I didn't want to block YouTube completely — YouTube is genuinely how I learn things myself, and I wanted my son to have that same ability to research topics, explore educational content, and develop the problem-solving habit of "let me figure this out." That's a skill I want him to have.

The problem was his feed. It was overrun with gamers screaming into microphones and brainrot content. I'd tell him to change the channel every time I walked by and heard one of those obnoxious gaming videos. He'd switch, but YouTube's algorithm would pull him right back within minutes. The algorithm is designed to keep kids glued — and it's very good at its job.

Every parental control I tried was either too restrictive (block YouTube entirely) or too permissive (YouTube Kids still recommends garbage). I needed the middle ground: let him explore and search freely, but give me the final say on what actually plays.

I'm not a developer — just a dad who wanted to protect his kid from YouTube's brainrot algorithms. I am a homelab enthusiast though, so I'm comfortable tinkering with self-hosted tools. I built this entirely with Claude (Anthropic's AI) — I described what I wanted, Claude wrote the code. Every release went through security reviews and code reviews via Claude before I pushed it.

BrainRotGuard removes the algorithm entirely. There's no autoplay, no "up next" sidebar, no recommendation engine pulling him deeper. He searches for what he wants, I approve or deny, and the video plays and stops. Done. No rabbit holes.

Don't want them watching gaming content? Block those channels. Tired of a specific creator? One tap. You can allow the channels you trust (educational, science, building, nature) and block the ones you don't — and it sticks. He picks what to ask for, I have the final say.

Now I curate his content and I can see the difference. He's not parroting gamer lingo back at me anymore. The stuff he watches is actually interesting — things he's curious about, things he's learning from. I pair this with Google Family Link on his device for general screen time, but BrainRotGuard is what controls YouTube specifically: daily time limits, scheduled access windows, and per-channel approval. Family Link says "the tablet turns off at 8pm." BrainRotGuard says "you can watch 2 hours of entertainment YouTube today, but educational content is unlimited — and only from channels I've approved."

## Features

### For Kids
- **Works on any device** — it's just a web page. Android tablet, iPad, laptop, phone, Kindle Fire — if it has a browser, it works
- **Simple search** — type what you want, see results, tap Request
- **Instant playback** — approved videos play immediately, no waiting
- **Video library** — browse everything that's been approved before
- **Category browsing** — filter by educational or entertainment content with one tap
- **Channel browsing** — see latest videos from pre-approved channels without needing to request each one
- **YouTube Shorts** — dedicated Shorts row with portrait thumbnails and a 9:16 player
- **Thumbnail previews** — hover or scroll to cycle through multiple thumbnails before requesting
- **Dark theme** — easy on the eyes, designed for tablets

### For Parents
- **Telegram approval** — approve/deny from anywhere with one tap
- **Channel allow/block lists** — trust a channel once, and new videos from it are auto-approved
- **Multi-child profiles** — separate PINs, watch history, and time budgets per child
- **Edu/Fun categories** — label channels and videos as educational or entertainment, each with its own daily time limit
- **Daily screen time limits** — set separate limits for educational and entertainment content, or a single global limit
- **Scheduled hours** — define when watching is allowed (e.g., 8am–7pm, not during school)
- **Per-day schedules** — different time windows and limits for each day of the week (e.g., relaxed weekends, tighter school days)
- **Guided setup wizard** — `/time setup` walks through limit mode and schedule configuration with inline buttons
- **Bonus time** — grant extra minutes for today only (`/time add 30`)
- **Shorts control** — toggle YouTube Shorts visibility across the entire app
- **Watch activity log** — see what was watched, for how long, grouped by category
- **Localized UI and bot** — English and Norwegian support, with locale-aware or forced 12h/24h time display
- **Word filters** — block videos whose titles contain specific words
- **Search history** — see everything your child has searched for
- **Starter channels** — curated list of kid-friendly channels (edu + fun) to import on first boot
- **Update notifications** — automatic Telegram alert when a new version is available on GitHub
- **PIN lock** — optional PIN gate so only your kid can access the web UI on the right device

### Privacy & Security
- **100% self-hosted** — runs entirely on your own hardware inside your home network. No cloud service, no third-party accounts, no subscriptions
- **No API key needed** — uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for search and metadata
- **Standard YouTube embeds** — videos play via `youtube.com` embeds (signing into a Google account on the tablet prevents bot-check interruptions)
- **Single-file database** — all data is one SQLite file on your machine. Nothing phones home.
- **Container runs as non-root** — Docker security best practice

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), a [Telegram bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot), and your [chat ID](docs/setup.md#step-2-get-your-chat-id). New to this? The **[full setup guide](docs/setup.md)** walks through everything step by step.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GHJJ123/brainrotguard.git
cd brainrotguard
cp .env.example .env
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit .env with your bot token and chat ID
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://<your-server-ip>:8080` on the kid's tablet.

**Pre-built image** (no build step, supports amd64 + arm64):
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ghjj123/brainrotguard:latest
```
See the [full setup guide](docs/setup.md#using-the-pre-built-docker-image) for compose file details.

**Unraid:** Search for **BrainRotGuard** in Community Applications, or download the template manually:
```bash
wget -O /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/my-brainrotguard.xml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GHJJ123/brainrotguard/main/unraid-template.xml
```
See the [full Unraid setup guide](docs/setup.md#installing-on-unraid) for details.

**Important:** You'll also want to [lock down the kid's device](docs/setup.md#step-5-lock-down-the-kids-device) so they can't bypass BrainRotGuard by opening YouTube directly.

## What You'll Need

| Requirement | What It Is |
|-------------|-----------|
| **A computer that stays on** | Raspberry Pi, old laptop, or home server — anything running Docker |
| **Docker** | [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) |
| **Telegram account** | The messaging app where you'll receive approval requests |
| **Telegram bot token** | Created in 5 minutes via [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) |
| **Device lockdown** | [Family Link](https://families.google.com/familylink/) (Android) or [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982) (iOS) to restrict browser access |

> **Why Telegram?** It was the easiest way to build instant notifications with approve/deny buttons that work from your phone. No custom app to develop, no push notification infrastructure to maintain — Telegram handles all of that.

> **Network note:** BrainRotGuard runs on your home network. Your child's device needs to be on the same network to access the web UI. You can approve/deny from anywhere via Telegram — you don't need to be home for that part.
